<div class="sectionRect">
  <p>
    It all started with a friendly challenge. My neighbor, who had his eye on a plot of land behind our apartment,
    wanted to plant maize, cassava, spinach, and okra. One day, during a casual chat, he asked why I hadnâ€™t used the
    little space behind my apartment to grow something myself.
