    It all started with a friendly challenge. My neighbor, who had his eye on a plot of land behind our apartment,
    wanted to plant maize, cassava, spinach, and okra. One day, during a casual chat, he asked why I hadn’t used the
    little space behind my apartment to grow something myself. Honestly, I’d always thought about starting a garden but
    never quite took the plunge. I told him if I were to plant anything, it would be tomatoes, peppers, okra, and maybe
    some other vegetables I found interesting.
