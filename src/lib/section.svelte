    The prices of local food commodities like tomatoes, peppers, and other vegetables were so expensive that recipes
    requiring a lot of tomatoes and peppers were avoided in favor of alternative soup ingredients. Rice, which is a
    major part of our meals, doubled in price, as did beans, which are heavily relied upon as a source of protein to
    prevent meals from being entirely energy-based.
